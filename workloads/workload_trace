# Twemcache Trace Replay Workload
#
# This workload replays traces from Twitter's cache-trace repository:
# https://github.com/twitter/cache-trace
#
# Trace files are zstd-compressed CSV files with the following format:
#   timestamp, key, key_size, value_size, client_id, operation, ttl
#
# Supported operations: get, gets, set, add, replace, cas, append, prepend, delete, incr, decr
#
# Download traces from:
#   - CMU PDL: https://ftp.pdl.cmu.edu/pub/datasets/twemcacheWorkload/open_source
#   - SNIA: http://iotta.snia.org/tracetypes/17
#
# Recommended clusters for different evaluations:
#   - miss ratio (admission, eviction): cluster52, cluster17, cluster18, cluster24, cluster44, cluster45, cluster29
#   - write-heavy: cluster12, cluster15, cluster31, cluster37
#   - TTL-related: cluster52, cluster22, cluster25, cluster11 (mix), cluster18, cluster19 (small TTLs)

# Workload type - must be "trace" or "twemcache"
workload=trace

# Path to the trace file (supports .zst compressed files)
# Example: trace.file=/path/to/cluster52.0.zst
trace.file=

# Table name for operations (default: usertable)
trace.table=usertable

# Field name for values (default: field0)
trace.fieldname=field0

# Maximum number of records to load from the trace (0 = unlimited)
# Useful for testing with a subset of the trace
trace.maxrecords=0

# Loop the trace when exhausted (default: false)
# If false, operations will stop when the trace is exhausted
trace.loop=false

# Number of threads for running operations
threadcount=1

# Operation count (total number of operations to perform)
# Set to the number of records in your trace or use maxexecutiontime
operationcount=1000000

# Alternative: max execution time in seconds (overrides operationcount if set)
# maxexecutiontime=60
